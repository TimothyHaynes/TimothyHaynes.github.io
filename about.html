			<h2>Why I want to be a developer?</h2>
			<p>	I have always wanted to work with technology. I never really saw myself as a coder, but I always wondered. It wasn't really until this year when I started taking courses online that I found that I actually enjoyed creating something from scratch. I like the fact that I can use developing as a way to get in touch with my creative side. I honestly never thought I was creative until I started taking these courses. So, I started Grand Circus to get into the field and see where developing takes me.</p>

			<h2>What is my background?</h2>
			<p>	My background is a little different than what most people have when they're in this field. I started off a long time ago as an audio egngineer in my school and I took even further with volunteer work. I did that for around 5 years and I absolutley loved every moment of it. Then I started working in Guest Services and Security at the Palace and DTE Music theater, at the time thinking I was going to go into law enforcement. I did that for 4 years and I learned a lot about people and how to handle difficult situations. Then I started training as a Firefighter and E.M.T. and started working paid on call at my local fire department. The triaining took about a year and I worked there for 3 1/2 years. I'm actually moving on from that job to go into development. I loved helping people and I learning a lot about working under pressure. However, I didn't want that as a career and I enjoy technology more than I enjoyed going on calls so it was a no-brainer. I also work part-time at BestBuy so I can really hone in selling skilss, because I know thats important in the business world. I think I'm going to keep that job for awhile as I go into this field.</p>

			<h2>Where do I want to be in 10 years?</h2>
			<p>	Now this one is a tough one. I definetly see myself in development. I'm not sure where though. Whether it's front-end, back-end, mobile, web, security, devops, cloud, architect, and/or engineer I'm not totally sure. All I know is that I want to be successful for myself, but even more importantly I want to be successful for my wife and daughter at home. If that means continuing to get my Bachelors degree and get an MBA, become a CIO, start a company, or make something great then that's what I'll do.</p>
